                <h3><a href="docs/ChronologicalCV.html" class="ready">The Past</a></h3>

                <p>An enthusiastic, engineer with many years of experience in the development of wired/wireless communication solutions. Including development, configuration management, integration, customer support and team leadership.</p>
                <p>I recently reached another top of the many hills in my career. While taking time-out I have been considering what to do next.</p>
                <p>On reflection I missed the good old days of development where I was learning new technology and feeling the highs of making technical contributions to projects. From here I could see that a return to some form of development would be exciting.</p>

            <section class="main" id="somethingoldnew">
                <h3>Something old or something new? </h3>
                <p>Should I stay in the are of communications or try something new? </p>
                <p>From my recent experience of working with wireless test systems I have gained knowledge in writing C++ object orientated test scripts upon Microsoft Visual Studio. </p>
                <p>From a technical point of view I have found object orientation to be very interesting and Visual Studio a reliable IDE.</p>

                <h3><a href="docs/WebDeveloperCV.html" class="ready">Web Development</a></h3>
                <p>My initial thoughts were to stay in the application area by adding C# skills to my toolbox but then I came across ASP.NET which opened my eyes to how sophisticated and rewarding Web Development could be.</p>
                <p>But where to start? And what steps to take?</p>
                <p>Then I remember a quote I gave whilst motivating my team after some bad news . . </p>
                <p>"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."</p>
                <p>So I decided to lay done some dots and here we are . . </p>
